            Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretoria"> Pretoria</a>,
            Transvaal, South Africa, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk#cite_note-30"><sup>[30]</sup></a>
            the son of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maye_Muskhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maye_Musk"> Maye
                Musk</a> (née
            Haldeman), a model and dietitian from Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada,[31] and Errol Musk, a South African
            electromechanical engineer, pilot, and sailor. He has a younger brother, Kimbal (born 1972), and a younger
            sister, Tosca (born 1974). <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk#cite_note-35"><sup>[35]</sup></a> His maternal
            grandfather, Dr. Joshua Haldeman, was an American-born
            Canadian. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk#cite_note-36"><sup>[36]</sup></a> <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk#cite_note-37"><sup>[37]</sup></a> His paternal grandmother
            was British, and he also has Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry. <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk#cite_note-sjmn20140411-38"><sup>[38]</sup></a> <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk#cite_note-39"><sup>[39]</sup></a>
            After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk lived mostly with his father in the suburbs of Pretoria,[38] which
            Musk chose two years after his parents split up, but now Musk says it was a mistake.As an adult, Musk
            has severed relations with his father, whom he has referred to as "a terrible human being". <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk#cite_note-rollingstone20171115-40"><sup>[40]</sup></a> He
            has a
            half-sister <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk#cite_note-41"><sup>[41]</sup></a> and a
            half-brother. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk#cite_note-42"><sup>[42]</sup></a>

            During his childhood, Musk was an avid reader. At the age of 10, he developed an interest in computing
            with the Commodore VIC-20. He taught himself computer programming at the age of 10, and by the age of 12
            sold the code of a BASIC-based video game he created called Blastar, to a magazine called PC and Office
            Technology, for approximately $500. A web version of the game is available online. His
            childhood reading included Isaac Asimov's Foundation series, from which he drew the lesson that "you should
            try to take the set of actions that are likely to prolong civilization, minimize the probability of a dark
            age and reduce the length of a dark age if there is one."

            Musk was severely bullied throughout his childhood and was once hospitalized when a group of boys threw
            him down a flight of stairs and then smashed his head into the pavement until he lost consciousness. He
            later revealed that he had to get a nose job, to repair the damage.

            Musk attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School and Bryanston High School before graduating from
            Pretoria Boys High School. Although Musk's father insisted that Elon go to college in Pretoria, Musk became
            determined to move to the United States. As he states, "I remember thinking and seeing that America is where
            great things are possible, more than any other country in the world." Knowing it would be easy to get to
            the United States from Canada, he moved to Canada against his father's wishes in June 1989, just before his
            18th birthday,after obtaining a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother.

            At the age of 17, in 1989, Elon Musk moved to Canada to attend Queen's University, avoiding mandatory
            service in the South African military. He left in 1992 to study business and physics at the University of
            Pennsylvania, and graduated with an undergraduate degree in economics and stayed for a second bachelor's
            degree in physics.

            After leaving Penn, Elon Musk headed to Stanford University in California to pursue a PhD in energy physics.
            However, his move coincided with the Internet boom, and he dropped out of Stanford after just two days to
            become a part of it, launching his first company, Zip2 Corporation.

            In 1995, Musk and his brother, Kimbal, started Zip2, a web software company, with money raised from a small
            group of angel investors. The company developed and marketed an Internet city guide for the newspaper
            publishing industry. Musk obtained contracts with The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune and
            persuaded the board of directors to abandon plans for a merger with CitySearch. While at Zip2, Musk
            wanted to become CEO; however, none of the board members would allow it. Compaq acquired <a href=""></a>
            Zip2 for US$307
            million in cash:109 and US$34 million in stock options[citation needed] in February 1999. Musk
            received US$22 million for his 7 percent share from the sale.:109

            merged company focused on the PayPal service and was renamed
            PayPal in 2001. PayPal's early growth was driven mainly by a <a

            were recruited when they received money through the service. <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk#cite_note-59"><sup>[59]</sup></a> Musk was ousted in
            October 2000 from his
            role as CEO (although he remained on the board) due to disagreements with other company leadership, notably
            over his desire to move PayPal's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix"> Unix</a>-based infrastructure

            Musk believed that the key to making space travel affordable is to make rockets reusable, Though most
            experts in the space industry did not believe that reusable rockets were possible or feasible.[76] On
            December 22, 2015, SpaceX successfully landed the first stage of its Falcon rocket back at the launch pad.
            This was the first time in history such a feat had been achieved by an orbital rocket and is a significant
            step towards rocket reusability lowering the costs of access to space.[77] This first stage recovery was
            replicated several times in 2016 by landing on an autonomous spaceport drone ship, an ocean-based recovery
            platform,[78] and by the end of 2017, SpaceX had landed and recovered the first stage on 16 missions in a
            row where a landing and recovery were attempted, including all 14 attempts in 2017. 20 out of 42 first stage
            Falcon 9 boosters have been recovered overall since the Falcon 9 maiden flight in 2010. In the most
            recent full year—2017—SpaceX launched 18 successful Falcon 9 flights, more than doubling their highest
            previous year of 8.
        </p>
        <p>
            On February 6, 2018, SpaceX successfully launched the Falcon Heavy, the fourth-highest capacity rocket ever
            built (after Saturn V, Energia and N1) and the most powerful rocket in operation as of 2018. The inaugural
            mission carried a Tesla Roadster belonging to Musk as a dummy payload.
        </p>
        SpaceX is both the largest private producer of rocket engines in the world and holder of the record for the
        highest thrust-to-weight ratio for a rocket engine (the Merlin 1D). SpaceX has produced more than
        100 operational Merlin 1D engines. Each Merlin 1D engine can vertically lift the weight of 40 average family
        cars. In combination, the 9 Merlin engines in the Falcon 9 first stage produce anywhere from 5.8 to 6.7 MN
        (1.3 to 1.5 million pounds) of thrust, depending on altitude.
        <p>
            Musk was influenced by Isaac Asimov's Foundation series and views space exploration as an important step
            in preserving and expanding the consciousness of human life. Musk said that multiplanetary life may
            serve as a hedge against threats to the survival of the human species.
        </p>
        An asteroid or a super volcano could destroy us, and we face risks the dinosaurs never saw: an engineered
        virus, inadvertent creation of a micro black hole, catastrophic global warming or some as-yet-unknown
        technology could spell the end of us. Humankind evolved over millions of years, but in the last sixty years
        atomic weaponry created the potential to extinguish ourselves. Sooner or later, we must expand life beyond
        this green and blue ball—or go extinct.
        <p>
            Musk's goal is to reduce the cost of human spaceflight by a factor of 10. In a 2011 interview, he said
            he hopes to send humans to Mars' surface within 10–20 years. In Ashlee Vance's biography, Musk stated
            that he wants to establish a Mars colony by 2040, with a population of 80,000. Musk stated that, since
            Mars' atmosphere lacks oxygen, all transportation would have to be electric (electric cars, electric trains,
            Hyperloop, electric aircraft).Musk stated in June 2016 that the first unmanned flight of the larger
            Mars Colonial Transporter (MCT) spacecraft is aimed for departure to the red planet in 2022, to be followed
            by the first manned MCT Mars flight departing in 2024. In September 2016, Musk revealed details of his
            architecture to explore and colonize Mars. By 2016, Musk's private trust holds 54% of SpaceX stock,
            equivalent to 78% of voting shares.

        <p>
            In late 2017, SpaceX unveiled the design for its next-generation launch vehicle and spacecraft
            system—BFR—that would support all SpaceX launch service provider capabilities with a single set of very
            large vehicles: Earth-orbit, Lunar-orbit, interplanetary missions, and even intercontinental passenger
            transport on Earth, and totally replace the Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy and Dragon vehicles in the 2020s. The BFR
            will have a 9-meter (30 ft) core diameter. Significant development on the vehicles began in 2017, while the
            new rocket engine development began in 2012.</p>
        <h3 id="tesla">Tesla</h3>
        <pre>   Main article: <a href="#">TEsla,inc.</a></pre>
        <p>Tesla, Inc. (originally Tesla Motors) was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning,
            who financed the company until the Series A round of funding.[95]

            Both men played active roles in the company's early development prior to Elon Musk's involvement.[96] Musk
            led the Series A round of investment in February 2004, joining Tesla's board of directors as its
            chairman.[97] Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design at a detailed
            level, but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.[98]

            Following the financial crisis in 2008 and after a series of escalating conflicts in 2007, Eberhard was
            ousted from the firm.[76][99] Musk assumed leadership of the company as CEO and product architect, positions
            he still holds today. Tesla Motors first built an electric sports car, the Tesla Roadster in 2008, with
            sales of about 2,500 vehicles to 31 countries. Tesla began delivery of its four-door Model S sedan on June
            22, 2012. It unveiled its third product, the Model X, aimed at the SUV/minivan market, on February 9, 2012;
            however, the Model X launch was delayed until September 2015.[100][101][102] In addition to its own cars,
            Tesla sells electric powertrain systems to Daimler for the Smart EV, Mercedes B-Class Electric Drive and
            Mercedes A Class, and to Toyota for the RAV4 EV. Musk was able to bring in both companies as long-term
            investors in Tesla.[103]

        <h3 id="solarcity">Solar City</h3>
        <p>Musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for SolarCity, which was then co-founded in 2006 by
            his
            cousins Lyndon and Peter Rive.[128][129] By 2013, SolarCity was the second largest provider of solar power
            systems in the United States.[130] SolarCity was acquired by Tesla, Inc. in 2016 and is currently a wholly
            owned
            subsidiary of Tesla.[131][132][133]

            The underlying motivation for funding both SolarCity and Tesla was to help combat global warming.[134] In
            2012,
            Musk announced that SolarCity and Tesla are collaborating to use electric vehicle batteries to smooth the
            impact
            of rooftop solar on the power grid, with the program going live in 2013.[135]

        </p>
        <h4 id="gigafactory">Gigafactory</h4>
        <p>On June 17, 2014, Musk committed to building a SolarCity advanced production facility in Buffalo, New York,
            that
            would triple the size of the largest solar plant in the United States. Musk stated the plant will be "one of
            the
            single largest solar panel production plants in the world," and it will be followed by one or more even
            bigger
            facilities in subsequent years.[136] The Tesla Gigafactory 2 is a photovoltaic (PV) cell factory, leased by
            Tesla subsidiary SolarCity in Buffalo, New York. Construction on the factory started in 2014 and was
            completed
            in 2017.[137]

        </p>
        <h3 id="hyperloop">Hyperloop</h3>
        <p>On August 12, 2013, Musk unveiled a concept for a high-speed transportation system incorporating
            reduced-pressure
            tubes in which pressurized capsules ride on an air cushion driven by linear induction motors and air
            compressors.[138] The mechanism for releasing the concept was an alpha-design document that, in addition to
            scoping out the technology, outlined a notional route where such a transport system might be built: between
            the
            Greater Los Angeles Area and the San Francisco Bay Area.[139]

            After earlier envisioning Hyperloop, Musk assigned a dozen engineers from Tesla and SpaceX who worked for
            nine
            months, establishing the conceptual foundations and creating the designs for the transportation
            system.[140][141] An early design for the system was then published in a whitepaper posted to the Tesla and
            SpaceX blogs.[142][143][144] Musk's proposal, if technologically feasible at the costs he has cited, would
            make
            Hyperloop travel cheaper than any other mode of transport for such long distances. The alpha design was
            proposed
            to use a partial vacuum to reduce aerodynamic drag, which it is theorized would allow for high-speed travel
            with
            relatively low power, with certain other features like air-bearing skis and an inlet compressor to reduce
            freestream flow. The document of alpha design estimated the total cost of an LA-to-SF Hyperloop system at
            US$6
            billion, but this amount is speculative.[145]

            In June 2015, Musk announced a design competition for students and others to build Hyperloop pods to operate
            on
            a SpaceX-sponsored mile-long track in a 2015–2017 Hyperloop pod competition. The track was used in January
            2017,
            and Musk also started building a tunnel.[146]

            Hyperloop One, a company unaffiliated with Musk, had announced that it had done its first successful test
            run on
            its DevLoop track in Nevada on July 13, 2017. It was on May 12, 2017, at 12:02 a.m. and had lasted 5.3
            seconds,
            reaching a top speed of 70 mph.[147]

            On July 20, 2017, Elon Musk announced that he had gotten verbal government approval to build a hyperloop
            from
            New York City to Washington, D.C., stopping in both Philadelphia and Baltimore.[148] However, the New York
            City
            Transit Authority, Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, Washington Metropolitan Area Transit
            Authority, Maryland Transit Administration, United States Department of Homeland Security, as well as the
            mayors
            of New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington D.C. stated that they are unaware of any such
            agreement.[149]</p>
        <h3 id="openai">OpenAI</h3>
        <p>In December 2015, Musk announced the creation of OpenAI, a not-for-profit artificial intelligence (AI)
            research
            company. OpenAI aims to develop artificial general intelligence in a way that is safe and beneficial to
            humanity.[150]

            By making AI available to everyone, OpenAI wants to "counteract large corporations who may gain too much
            power
            by owning super-intelligence systems devoted to profits, as well as governments which may use AI to gain
            power
            and even oppress their citizenry."[151] Musk has stated he wants to counteract the concentration of
            power.[39]
            In 2018 Musk left the OpenAI board to avoid possible future conflicts with his role as CEO of Tesla as Tesla
            increasingly becomes involved in AI.[152]

            However, in an interview with Joe Rogan in September 2018, Musk warned about the dangers of developing
            artificial intelligence indiscriminately. In January 2019 Mark Harris of The Guardian noted that on 23
            January
            the Musk foundation "added a line to its website, stating its support for the “development of safe
            artificial
            intelligence to benefit humanity”".[153]</p>
        <h3 id="neuralink">Neuralink</h3>
        <p>In 2016, Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology startup company to integrate the human brain with
            artificial intelligence. The company is centered on creating devices that can be implanted in the human
            brain, with the eventual purpose of helping human beings merge with software and keep pace with advancements
            in artificial intelligence. These enhancements could improve memory or allow more direct interfacing with
            computing devices.[154] Musk sees Neuralink and OpenAI as related: "OpenAI is a nonprofit dedicated to
            minimizing the dangers of artificial intelligence, while Neuralink is working on ways to implant technology
            into our brains to create mind-computer interfaces."[39]</p>
        <h3 id="tbcompany">The Boring Company</h3>
        <p>On December 17, 2016, while stuck in traffic, Musk tweeted "Am going to build a tunnel boring machine and
            just start digging ..." The company was named 'The Boring Company'.[155] On January 21, 2017, Musk tweeted
            "Exciting progress on the tunnel front. Plan to start digging in a month or so."[156] The first tunnel will
            start on the SpaceX campus,[157] The Boring Test Tunnel runs underneath West 120th Street. As of January 26,
            2017, discussions with regulatory bodies had begun.</p>

        <p><img src="ted_show.jpeg"
                alt="Elon Musk in Ted show" class="as">In February 2017, the company began digging a 30-foot-wide,
            50-foot-long, and 15-foot-deep "test trench" on
            the premises of Space X's offices in Los Angeles, since the construction requires no permits.[159][160] Musk
            had said in early 2017 that a 10-fold decrease in tunnel boring cost per mile is necessary for economic
            feasibility of the proposed tunnel network.[161] By late 2018, TBC had active construction, approved plans
            in place, or an operational tunnel in several areas of the United States: Baltimore,[162] Chicago[163] and
            Los Angeles. TBC provided an update on the state of their technology and product line when they opened to
            the public their first mile-long test tunnel in Hawthorne, California, on 18 December 2018, stating that it
            has been a proof-of-concept for the technology.[164][165] Design is complete for the third-generation Boring
            TBM, Prufrock, slated to support a 15x improvement in tunneling speed over the existing state of the art,
            and the machine will be assembled and begin engineering testing in 2019.[164]:15:18–15:45</p>

        <h3 id="pravduh.com">pravduh.com</h3>
        <p>After a string of negative press targeting Tesla caused Musk to become frustrated,[166] specifically articles
            published by Reveal News criticizing Tesla for its factory safety procedures,[167] Musk announced on Twitter
            that he is planning on creating a website where users could rate the truthfulness of specific articles in
            addition to the credibility of journalists and publications.[168] He suggested calling it "Pravda" after a
            Soviet Union-era Communist Party newspaper of the same name.

            This caused backlash from many journalists, claiming that a platform where any user could freely vote on an
            article's or a journalist's credibility could be prone to abuse.[169][170]

            After realizing the site "pravda.com" is used by the Ukrainian Internet newspaper Ukrayinska Pravda, Musk
            bought the site pravduh.com on May 25, 2018.[171]

        </p>
        <h3 id="tlcRescue">Tham Luang cave rescue</h3>
        <p>In July 2018, Musk attempted to provide assistance to rescuers during the Tham Luang cave rescue by ordering
            his employees to build a small rescue pod.

            Musk, responding to requests for help from Twitter users,[172] contacted James Yenbamroong, CEO of
            Thailand-based satellite company Mu Space, to get him connected with the Thai government.[173] He then
            ordered engineers from two of his companies to design a child-sized submarine to help the rescue effort and
            publicised the process via Twitter.[174][175] Engineers at Musk's companies SpaceX and The Boring Company
            built the mini-submarine out of a Falcon 9 liquid oxygen transfer tube[176] and personally delivered it to
            Thailand.

            Named "Wild Boar" after the children's soccer team,[177] its design, a five-foot (1.5 m)-long, twelve-inch
            (300 mm)-inch wide sealed tube weighing about 90 pounds (41 kg) propelled manually by divers in the front
            and back,[178] was intended to solve the problem of safely transporting the children, who might have had
            difficulty learning the scuba skills required to exit the cave on their own without panicking.[179] In case
            the mini-submarine could not fit through the cave system, Elon Musk also requested Wing Inflatables, a
            California-based inflatable boat manufacturer, to build inflatable escape pods. The pods were designed,
            fabricated, and tested in one day before being flown to Thailand.[180][181]

            By this time, eight of the twelve children had already been rescued and Thai authorities decided not to use
            the submarine, describing it as technologically impressive but impractical.</p>
        <h3 id="dv">Device viability</h3>
        <p>The supervisor of the rescue operation Narongsak Osatanakorn dismissed the submarine as impractical under the
            current circumstances. A rescue caver who had been exploring the cave for the past six years and who had
            originally located the trapped football team, said that Musk's idea "had absolutely no chance of working ...
            the submarine, I believe, was about five foot six long, rigid, so it wouldn't have gone round corners or
            round any obstacles. It wouldn't have made the first 50 metres into the cave from the dive start
            point."[185][186] Musk tweeted that Richard Stanton, leader of the international diving team, had earlier
            urged Musk to continue construction of the mini-submarine as a back-up, in case the flooding worsened.[187]

            Although the device could safely hold an occupant, there were concerns that its rigid body was only slightly
            smaller than the narrowest passages in the cave, making it risky to get it through the tighter turns.</p>
        <h3 id="mc&mc">Media coverage and Musk's behavior</h3>
        <p>As media coverage of the event grew, some were skeptical of Musk's intentions, claiming the submarine was
            mainly built for publicity for Tesla and Musk, citing the apparent uselessness of the device.[188][189][190]

            One of the divers said to have played a major role in the rescue criticized the submarine as amounting to
            nothing more than a public relations effort with no chance of success, and that Musk "had no conception of
            what the cave passage was like";[191] and said that Musk "can stick his submarine where it hurts". Musk
            reasserted on Twitter that the device would have worked and referred to the diver as "pedo guy" without
            offering any evidence to support the claim, causing backlash against Musk.[192][193] He subsequently deleted
            the tweets, along with an earlier tweet in which he told another critic of the device "Stay tuned
            jackass".[193] On 16 July, the diver stated that he was considering legal action in relation to Musk's
            comments.[194][195]

            After Musk's Tweets, Tesla shares fell 4% as some investors worried about his erratic behavior.[196] Tesla
            investors subsequently demanded that Musk apologize.[197] Two days later, Musk issued an apology for his
            remarks:[198][199] "The fault is mine and mine alone"[200] and "my words were spoken in anger".[201]

            On August 28, 2018, in response to criticism from a writer on Twitter regarding how Musk had handled the
            diver's criticism, Musk circled back to the pedophilia accusation tweeting "You don't think it's strange he
            hasn't sued me? He was offered free legal services. ...".[202] The following day, a letter from L. Lin Wood,
            the rescuer's attorney, dated August 6, emerged, showing that he had been making preparations for a libel
            lawsuit.[203][204]

            On 5 September 2018, a reporter from Buzzfeed News published an email written by Musk on August 30 marked
            "off the record", saying "I suggest that you call people you know in Thailand, find out what's actually
            going on and stop defending child rapists, you fucking asshole. As for this alleged threat of a lawsuit,
            which magically appeared when I raised the issue ... I fucking hope he sues me." Musk confirmed that he had
            sent the email.[205] The diver subsequently filed a defamation suit in Los Angeles federal court in
            mid-September 2018, with plans to also file a similar case in the United Kingdom. The lawsuit contends that
            "Musk embarked on a PR campaign to destroy [the diver]'s reputation by publishing false and heinous
            accusations of criminality against him to the public", and seeks upwards of US$75,000 in damages.</p>
        <h3 id="teslaquila">Teslaquila</h3>
        <p>Musk first mentioned Teslaquila in an April Fools tweet in 2018.[208] The proposed Tesla-branded tequila
            become closer to a reality in October 2018 as Tesla filed an 'intent to use' trademark application with the
            U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.[209] The trademark is for distilled agave liquor. Musk reaffirmed his
            intention to release the product with a tweet, featuring a mockup of the bottle, on October 12.[210]

            Mexico's Tequila Regulatory Council (CRT) has publicly denounced the proposed product, arguing, "If it wants
            to make Teslaquila viable as a tequila it would have to associate itself with an authorized tequila
            producer, comply with certain standards and request authorization from Mexico's Industrial Property
            Institute".</p>
        <h3 id="music">Music</h3>
        <p>On March 30, 2019, Musk released a rap single to SoundCloud under the username "Emo G Records".[212] Titled
            "RIP Harambe", the track was performed by Yung Jake, written by Yung Jake and Caroline Polachek, and
            produced by BloodPop.[213][214] Within ten days, the song had achieved more than 2,000,000 plays</p>

 Politically, Musk has described himself as "half Democrat, half Republican" and "I'm somewhere in the
                middle, socially liberal and fiscally conservative."[215] Prompted by the emergence of self-driving cars
                and artificial intelligence, Musk has voiced support for a universal basic income;[216] he additionally
                backs direct democracy.[217] He has described himself as a socialist, but "not the kind that shifts
                resources from most productive to least productive, pretending to do good, while actually causing harm"
                - arguing instead, "true socialism seeks greatest good for all."[218] He supports targeting an inclusive
                tax rate of 40%, prefers consumption taxes to income taxes, and supports the estate tax, as the
                "probability of progeny being equally excellent at capital allocation is not high."[219]

                Musk has described the United States as "[inarguably] the greatest country that has ever existed on
                Earth," describing it as "the greatest force for good of any country that's ever been." Musk believes
                democracy would not exist any longer if not for the United States, saying that it prevented this
                disappearance on three occasions through its participation in World War I, World War II and the Cold
                War. Musk also stated that he thinks "it would be a mistake to say the United States is perfect, it
                certainly is not. There have been many foolish things the United States has done and bad things the
                United States has done."[220]</p>

            <h4 id="2010-2016">2010-2016</h4>
            <p>In Iron Man 2 (2010), Musk met Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) in a restaurant, and had some brief lines
                regarding an "idea for an electric jet."[318] In January 2015, Musk made a guest appearance playing
                himself on The Simpsons in an episode titled "The Musk Who Fell to Earth"; the episode poked fun at many
                of Musk's ideas.[319] In November 2015, Musk appeared in an episode of The Big Bang Theory, playing
                himself, volunteering at a soup kitchen with Wolowitz.[320] Musk was featured in the 2015 environmental
                documentary Racing Extinction, in which a custom Tesla Model S was designed to help project images of
                critically endangered species onto public buildings, including the Empire State Building and the
                Vatican.[321] In 2016, Musk appeared as himself in the romantic comedy film Why Him? where he was
                briefly met by one of the main characters, Ned Flemming played by Bryan Cranston, in a bar at a
                party.[322] Also in 2016, Musk was referenced by Dr. Martin Stein on The CW time-travel TV show DC's
                Legends of Tomorrow. During time travel to the past, Stein meets his younger self and introduced himself
                as Elon Musk, to disguise his own identity.</p>
            <h4 id="2017-">2017-Present</h4>
            <p>In October 2017, Musk was prematurely immortalized as a historic pioneer on the CBS All Access series
                Star Trek: Discovery. Set in the year 2256, Captain Gabriel Lorca attempts to motivate a scientist on
                his ship by asking him "How do you want to be remembered in history? Alongside the Wright Brothers, Elon
                Musk, Zefram Cochrane? Or as a failed fungus expert. A selfish little man who put the survival of his
                own ego before the lives of others?"[324][325] According to a TechCrunch article published the day after
                the episode aired, this mention is "also interesting because of its notable omission of Amazon and Blue
                Origin founder Jeff Bezos: This other space entrepreneur is such a big fan of Star Trek that he pitched
                and succeeded in landing a cameo in Star Trek Beyond as an alien being, but he doesn't rate a mention
                from Lorca among the spaceflight pantheon."[326] Musk is significantly referenced numerous times in Hat
                Films' 2017 album, Neon Musk.[327] In November 2017, Musk appeared as himself in season 1, episode 6 of
                The Big Bang Theory spin-off prequel series Young Sheldon. The successful first landing of a SpaceX
                Falcon 9 first stage on a drone ship on April 8, 2016, is shown being covered by CNN. This is followed
                by a scene where Musk is shown alone in his office reading the notebook that young Sheldon mailed NASA
                in 1989 (a scene shown earlier in the episode) containing calculations detailing how this feat could be
                accomplished.[328] In February 2019, Musk co-hosted YouTuber PewDiePie's show "Meme Review" with Justin
                Roiland under the request of PewDiePie's fans.</p>
